Worked as **Gameplay Programmer**  
*2024 September 23 - 2024 Septemper 27*

This game was made for the initial Gamejam at Yrgo over 4 days. The theme was "Flip" so we made a game where you would have to flip bugs to be able to kill them before they reached your gnome camp. It was a fun experience to collaborate with artists and other programmers in Unity and I'm quite proud of the game we made.

As a gameplay programmer I worked on most aspects of the game but my focus was on the character control and abilities.

I also worked on the "level design" by setting up the waves of monsters to try and make the difficulty curve as smooth and satisfying as possible.

**What I worked on:** 
- Character Script.
- Game Design.
- Game Balancing.
- Tutorial.
- UI and menues.

**Tools I worked with:** 
- Unity
