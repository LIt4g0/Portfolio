Worked as **Gameplay Programmer**  
*2024 November - 2025 January*

This was the first big team project at Yrgo, the assignment was to make a 2D game in Unity. You play as a robot in the far future who's head has broken off from it's body. You will have to carry the head with you throughout the game, keeping in mind that your perspective is from the head and not your body. You solve puzzles while learning bit by bit about this post apocalyptic world.
