Worked as **Gameplay Programmer**  
*2025 March - 2025 April*

This game was made during our Unreal Engine course at Yrgo. The assignment was to make a solo game focusing on utilizing the strengths of the Unreal Engine.

I first started prototyping a game where you would jump from mini planet to mini planet, manipulating gravity so that you would be attracted to whichever planet was closest. I had several great ideas and the core mechanic was in place but I decided to focus on making a smaller game instead.

I decided to make a first person game where you take control of the characters you shoot. Each character you possess is unique in size and mass, this enables you to go places or do things that would not be possible with the other characters. You will have to consider the mass of a characters in order to press down a button or balance multiple characters on a see saw. This all combined into a pretty neat game, I would describe it as a unique and frustratingly challenging but fun puzzle platformer. Utilizing Unreal Engine's strong First Person Perpsective focus and rapid level design tools I was able to build this game in less than a month.
